                                At Bilingual Nature Academy, we provide a unique early learning experience that nurtures the brain, body, and soul through a balanced blend of child-led exploration and thoughtful classroom learning. Located on beautiful Whidbey Island, our bilingual program fosters curiosity, creativity, and confidence in both English and Spanish.

                                What makes us unique? We embrace a holistic, child-led approachâ€”encouraging children to follow their interests and develop a lifelong love for learning. 60% of our learning takes place outdoors, where children engage with nature, move their bodies, and explore the world around them. The other 40% takes place indoors in a more structured, carefully designed Montessori and Reggio Emilia-inspired classroom, where hands-on discovery and independence thrive.

                                We view our environment as "The 3rd Teacher," shaping learning experiences that inspire curiosity, problem-solving, and meaningful connections.

                                Give your child the gift of language, adventure, and discovery.
